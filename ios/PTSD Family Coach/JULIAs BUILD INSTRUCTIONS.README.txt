	JULIA's APP-BUILDING INSTRUCTIONS
FEB 2015

ENTERPRISE DISTRIBUTION IN XCODE

1. Change Bundle ID (e.g., net.health-space.Family-Coach-Full-Catalyze)
(if you have already created a .plist file, make sure it matches the App's Bundle ID)

2. Take existing provisioning profile (~Wildcard_Jan_2015), and double click
to ensure that it's added to keychain of your current device running xcode

3. CLICK on link to app's targets & platforms, 

4.  On the "GENERAL" settings tab, make sure TEAM is set to TransEnD

5. On the "Build Settings" tab, make sure  -> Code Signing (ALL ATTRIBUTES) are set to TransEnD
  -Code Signing Identity
  -Debug
  -Any iOS SDK
  -Release
  -Any iOS SDK
  -Provisioning Profile: Wildcard Profile May 2015

6. Product -> Archive (and then wait for xcode to do its work, compiling all source files)

6. an "Organizer | Archives" window should appear: Change comment to say something about the build

7.    Press "EXPORT..." -> save for Enterprise Development, select development team "TransEnD"

8.      Export -> famcoachcatalyze.ipa (this is the app) & save to directory of choice

9. Modify .plist file to specify BundleID and link to a secure website
   where the app (.ipa file) is hosted
   - BEST solution is to let XCODE create this, but I haven't been able to do this with specified parameters yet
   - FOR NOW, modify previously-used .plist files by changing: BundleID, secure server where the .ipa file is hosted 
   
10. Create link to the app using tinyurl with the following link to:
itms-services:///?action=download-manifest&url=http://www.health-space.net/familycoach/builds/research/famcoachcatalyze.plist

/* DELETE BELOW, BUT FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS FIRST! */
/* convert string above, starting with "itms-services:///" */
/* using tinyurl.com  */
/* replace link at end with link to location of .plist file */
/* MUST BE HTTPS://    */
