                        <b>Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</b> is an anxiety disorder caused by experiencing traumatic events, such as combat, 
                        disasters, terrorism, serious accidents, or physical or sexual assault.  PTSD includes 3 types of symptoms. 
                        <ol>
                            <li>Reexperiencing or reliving the trauma, such as having flashbacks, nightmares, or becoming very upset when reminded of the trauma.</li>
                            <li>Avoiding or staying away from places or people because they remind you of the trauma, isolating from others, and/or feeling numb.</li>
                            <li>Increased arousal such as feeling on guard, being irritable, trouble sleeping or startling easily.</li>
                        </ol>
                        Symptoms may lead to problems in functioning in social or family life, work, and school.

                        After a trauma, it’s normal to have painful memories and to become upset when reminded of what happened.  Trauma also can affect how people 
                        think about themselves, others, the world, and the future.  For most, these reactions lessen over time and thinking returns to normal. For some,
                        however, reactions continue and are severe; they disrupt living, and beliefs remain negative and intense.  How people respond to these early, normal
                        reactions, in part, can determine if PTSD develops.  For example, because memories and reminders of the trauma are painful, it makes sense to want 
                        to avoid them.  However, too much avoidance can prevent a person from adequately dealing with the memories and reminders and making sense of what 
                        happened.  This may lead normal trauma reactions to become more lasting PTSD symptoms.

                        Although most people recover after a trauma, it is not uncommon for people to develop PTSD.  About 7% of the general US population will have PTSD
                        in their lifetime, with women being more than twice as likely to develop it as men.  Following a trauma, it can be expected that around 20% of 
                        women and 8% of men will develop PTSD.  Certain types of trauma, such as rape and combat, can cause even higher rates.

                        <p>
                            Developing PTSD is not a sign of weakness.  Virtually anyone can develop PTSD.  However, there are some factors that can make it more likely.
                            These include being female, having a prior trauma, having been abused as a child, having a pre-existing mental health problem, and a family 
                            history of mental illness. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Reactions <b>during</b> trauma can increase your risk. For example, believing you will die, feeling detached from yourself or your surroundings, 
                            feeling completely helpless, and having a panic attack are signs that the event was especially traumatic.  Being seriously injured also 
                            puts one at higher risk.  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Risk factors <b>after</b> trauma include lack of social support and experiencing additional life stressors (e.g., job loss, divorce).

                        PTSD symptoms usually appear very soon after trauma.  For about 70% of people, these symptoms go away on their own within the weeks and months 
                        after the trauma.  For some (about 30%) the symptoms can last for many years.  PTSD symptoms can stay at a fairly constant level of severity or 
                        individuals can have periods when symptoms are not very intense and other times when symptoms are severe.  PTSD symptoms can worsen during times 
                        of stress or when trauma survivors are reminded of the trauma (e.g., anniversaries).  How long PTSD lasts also depends on whether effective treatment 
                        is received.

                        Other problems also commonly occur alongside PTSD.  These include depression, other anxiety disorders, and alcohol and substance abuse.  In fact, 
                        more than half of men with PTSD have alcohol problems and nearly half of women with PTSD have depression.  PTSD also can reduce one’s ability to
                        function in their relationships, at work and school, and in leisure activities.  In addition, people with PTSD may suffer physical symptoms and
                        may be at increased risk of medical problems.

                            PTSD is treated with talk therapy or medication, or a combination of these.  The most effective treatments for PTSD are 
                            exposure-based cognitive-behavioral therapies (CBT).  These treatments involve exploring how the trauma has negatively affected
                            one’s thinking and helping survivors think in more balanced ways about what happened and what it might mean. Treatment may also 
                            include having the trauma survivor spend time safely, and with support, with the painful trauma memories and reminders that they’ve 
                            been avoiding, seeing that they can survive them and be ok.  Individuals are also taught coping skills to more effectively deal 
                            with stress and manage PTSD symptoms, much like the skills available on this app.

                            Only a trained mental health professional can determine if you have PTSD.  However, there are self-tests, including the one on
                            this app, which can help you decide if your symptoms require a more thorough evaluation from a professional.  If you suspect
                            that you have PTSD, talk with your doctor or schedule an evaluation with a mental health professional.  Also, it is important 
                            to remember that some people may develop other conditions, such as depression, after experiencing a trauma. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If your trauma was less than 3 months ago and you are not in too much distress or having problems functioning with work, 
                            relationships or school, then you may just want to watch and wait to see if your symptoms get better on their own.  Using the 
                            tools in this app can help.  If your symptoms do not get better after 3 months, seek professional help.

                        Whether or not you need help can only be determined by you and a trained healthcare professional. However, you can go and take the
                        self-assessment on this app to see if you are scoring in the high, medium, or low range of symptoms. You can also ask yourself these

                        <p>
                        The first few weeks after a traumatic event can be hard. It is common to have trouble with life, avoid situations, feel very nervous, 
                        and have trouble sleeping. But if you don’t get better in the first month, then you should think about talking to a counselor.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        People close to you mean well, but they may not be able to help you the way you need them to. Maybe you would like to talk with your 
                        friends and family, but you are away from them right now. Experiences like rape, assault, domestic violence, loss of a buddy, or a 
                        friendly-fire related incident may feel too private or sensitive. You may feel uneasy or unsafe to talk with someone you know.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        One of the most helpful ways to feel better and get back on track is to work with a mental health provider. However, many people don’t seek 
                        counseling even though they might benefit. Professionals who specialize in working with PTSD can help you learn to manage your feelings 
                        and thoughts. They can also help you feel relaxed about talking to people in your daily life, pursuing your goals, and focusing on your 
                        future. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Keep in mind that seeking counseling is a sign of strength, not weakness. Talking to a counselor can improve your ability to help yourself.

                        Scientific evidence shows that many types of therapy and medications really do work. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        It may be hard to imagine now, but you can get past your stress.  Counseling may also help ease your transition back home. Like many 
                        others that have received counseling, there is a very good chance that you will thank yourself later for sitting through a few 
                        uncomfortable hours. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        If you are worried that counselors can’t help you or won’t understand what you have been through, you may be surprised to find out that
                        this may not be true. Counselors are well trained professionals. Some of them even specialize in working with military personnel and
                        veterans, rape victims, or other special populations. They cannot help or understand you if you don’t give them a chance. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        If you have a few sessions with a counselor and you don't think it's going well, you can talk to the counselor about what you want
                        changed or you can ask for a different counselor.  Counselors are interested in your recovery and will help you get the person you
                        need.

                        <p>
                        The good news is that there are several types of treatment that work for PTSD.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        The best evidence supports cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for PTSD. Two types of CBT that have the most research behind 
                        them are Cognitive Processing Therapy and Prolonged Exposure Therapy.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Research also supports the use of Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing, or EMDR, and finally, medications called Selective 
                        Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors, or SSRIs.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        If you have PTSD, you can look for a talk therapist who uses one of these approaches. In the VA, you should have no problem finding 
                        someone to provide one of the services listed above.

                        When considering professional counseling, many people worry about practical things that may keep them from getting help. Concerns 
                        about how to find a counselor, the cost of treatment, getting time off from work, and transportation to appointments are very common. 
                        Each is addressed briefly below.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        <b>Finding a counselor:</b> A good place to start your search for a counselor is to ask your doctor for a referral.  You can also 
                        call your insurance company and ask for suggestions. If you are a veteran, you can also call your local VA hospital or medical facility 
                        and ask for recommendations. The number is 877-222-8387. You can also check out the Locate Professional Care Near Me, under the Find
                        Support tab to find web links to resources for counseling and support.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        <b>Cost:</b> Try not to worry about how much counseling will cost, until you have details. Think of counseling as an investment in your 
                        health and well-being. It helps you live a happier fuller life. Call your insurance company and find out about your benefits. For veterans, 
                        the VA offers free care for combat-related conditions for five years after the person returns from deployment. It also offers services 
                        for other veterans as well. Call the VA to determine your benefits at 800-827-1000.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        <b>Time off from work:</b> If you need flexible appointments so you do not miss work, look for a counselor that will work with your 
                        schedule. You want to find a good time where you won't feel rushed. Most employers will understand and help you take care of your health; 
                        whether it’s physical or emotional. Often, people work out a flexible schedule with their boss to free up time for their appointment. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        <b>Transportation:</b> Some people have problems getting to and from appointments. If this is a problem for you, look into public 
                        transportation. Another option is to catch a ride with someone. Maybe, you can even arrange to borrow a vehicle. Some counseling centers 
                        offer transportation services for veterans. Ask your center if this is offered. Consider all your options. You might be surprised at how 
                        many people will take the time to help you get to an appointment.

                        <b>Remember: we are not alone in this world. People are here to help.</b> Perhaps you believe that you should be able to handle your 
                        problems without help from others. But, people who use the sources of help around them are able to cope better than those who 
                        choose not to.  Trying to cope completely by yourself often makes things harder than needed. It adds loneliness and isolation to your 
                        problems.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        You may think that needing help means that you're not normal. You may also believe that seeking help means that you are not fit to do 
                        normal things. It is common to have problems. Many people report some type of concern about their mental health after stressful experiences.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Don’t feel guilty about taking time to get yourself well. You will be better able to live a normal life if you are feeling better.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Counseling is not just for weak or broken people. Talking about your experiences helps you feel better and stronger. And getting the support
                        you need to live your life more fully shows strength, self-respect, growth, and courage.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        The important thing is for you to feel better, even if you have to swallow your pride for a few weeks of counseling. It will all be worth 
                        it when you get your life back.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        You don’t have to tell people that you’re working with a counselor. You can just say you have an appointment and that it’s personal.  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Try not to be upset with people that worry about you. Their concern can come from a good place and wanting good things for you. They 
                        may be on your side even if they are treating you differently. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Put yourself in their shoes. Think of a moment when a friend was having a hard time. Did you judge them for it, or were you glad that 
                        you could help? Friends, as well as family, want the best for you and are probably looking for ways to help.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        You may think that people will make fun of you for getting help, because at one point you may have overheard someone making fun of 
                        someone in your situation.  But you will come to find out that this usually isn’t true. It's normal to have problems. Many men and women 
                        who served in the military have reported some concern about their mental health after their return. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Believing that you will be embarrassed and shamed for asking for help is the biggest reason that people, including service members and 
                        veterans, don't seek help. But, take a minute to ask yourself the following questions. Is it more important for me to worry about what 
                        someone else thinks of me? Or, is it important to get the help I need to move on with my life? 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        A primary care physician is also called a PCP.  A primary care physician is a medical doctor (M.D.) with a degree to practice general 
                        medicine. This means that she can treat common medical problems, and may also be trained to recognize and help with common psychological
                        problems, such as depression and anxiety. A PCP may prescribe medicine to help with depression and sleep.  PCPs are a good first contact 
                        to help you find the services you need.   They can refer you to an expert like a psychologist, psychiatrist or social worker, who can 
                        help you better address your problems. Primary care physicians are very well educated and experienced. They have completed medical school,
                        which takes an extra 4 years after graduating from college. Plus, MDs must complete a 3 to 4 year specialized training after medical school.
                        You can find a physician in the military and Veterans Affairs (VA) health care systems, through recommendations from people you know,
                        or through a referral from a doctor, nurse, or your insurance company. If you need medical attention, a prescription, or a referral to a specialist,
                        then your PCP is the best place to start.

                        <p>
                        Social workers work with people who are struggling with depression, anxiety, PTSD, and substance use problems. They also help people with
                        more severe mental health issues, and family and relationship difficulties.  Social workers help clients with other challenges including
                        finding employment, housing, and government benefits. They also practice psychotherapy or “talk therapy,” which involves teaching people 
                        skills for coping and living. Social workers are not medical doctors and cannot prescribe medications. Social workers usually have a 
                        master’s degree in social work that takes 2 years after college is finished, though some social workers have a doctoral degree in social 
                        work. Social workers also must complete supervised experience and receive a license to work.  Social workers often work for local agencies 
                        and local mental health programs. There are many social workers in the military and Veterans Administration health care systems. You can 
                        find a social worker through advice from people you know or referrals from a doctor, nurse, or your insurance company.  If you need 
                        someone to help you get back on track with getting a job, housing, government benefits, or you just need someone who will listen and refer
                        you to an expert, then a social worker can help.

                        <p>
                        Psychologists work with clients who have many concerns, including depression, anxiety, PTSD, and substance use problems.  Psychologists 
                        also work with singles, couples, families and groups.  They help people deal with other life problems such as family and relationship 
                        problems.  Licensed psychologists have a Ph.D. or Psy.D. in psychology or a related field. This takes about 5 years after college to 
                        complete. They must also complete supervised professional experience. Although Psychologists are called doctors, they are not medical 
                        doctors and cannot prescribe medicine. Their role is to provide assessment and talk therapy. There are psychologists in the community 
                        and working throughout military and Veterans Affairs health care. You can find a psychologist through advice from people you know 
                        or referrals from a doctor, nurse, or your insurance company.

                        <p>
                        Psychiatrists treat a variety of mental health problems, including depression, anxiety, PTSD, substance use problems, and severe mental 
                        illnesses.  Psychiatrists primarily treat patients with a variety of medications that can ease depression and anxiety, help 
                        with sleep, and help with symptoms of mental illness.  Some psychiatrists also practice psychotherapy or “talk therapy”. Psychiatrists are 
                        medical doctors, MDs, meaning that they have completed medical school after graduating from college. After medical school, psychiatrists 
                        also complete specialized training in psychiatry, which usually takes another 3 to 4 years. Psychiatrists work in the community and 
                        throughout military and Veterans Affairs health care. You can find a psychiatrist through advice from people you know or referrals 
                        from a doctor, nurse, or your insurance company. Your primary care provider, social worker, or psychologist can help you make an appointment
                        with a psychiatrist.

                        <p>
                        A pastoral counselor or chaplain is a member of the clergy who provides spiritual support and guidance, conducts religious services in the
                        field, and offers support in emergency situations. Chaplains help people regardless of their faith and religious beliefs. Chaplains are
                        not trained to provide mental health counseling, but they can refer you to a specialist like a psychologist, psychiatrist or social worker, 
                        who can help you address your emotional difficulties more thoroughly.  If you are looking for spiritual guidance as part of your road to 
                        receiving professional care, then perhaps a pastoral counselor or chaplain is a great start for you.

			This graph shows how your scores on the self-assessment have changed over time. It is normal for your symptoms to go up and down a bit 
			from day to day.  It is most important to look for a trend over time.  Lower scores mean that you have less severe symptoms. So if your 
			line is going down, that is good news. Higher scores mean that you have more severe symptoms, so if your line is going up, you may want 
			to check in with your provider and let him or her know (or get a provider if you don't already have one).

			The self-assessment in this app is called the PTSD Checklist or PCL. This scale has been used with people with PTSD for screening, 
			diagnosis, and monitoring for many years and has been scientifically validated. It was originally developed in 1993 by the National 
			Center for PTSD. It includes 17 questions, each of which has 5 possible answers. This assessment cannot tell you if you have PTSD -- 
			only a trained mental health provider can do that. However, it can give you some valuable information about how severe your symptoms 
			are, and if you are getting better or worse over time.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you are worried that you might have PTSD but you have never been diagnosed, it’s important to talk with your doctor to get a 
			referral to a mental health provider.

			Once you take the self-assessment your results will show up here as a graph. You can watch your scores change over time. Remember, 
			no one will see your results other than you. This is an opportunity to get feedback on how severe your symptoms are, and if you are 
			getting better or worse over time.  To take the self-assessment now, tap "Back" and then tap "Take Assessment" on the main Assess screen.

			You can track your symptoms by scheduling times to take the self-assessment in the future. It is normal for your symptoms to change a 
			bit from day to day.  It is most important to look for a trend over time.  So, you should not take this self-assessment more than once
			per week. In most cases we suggest one time per month. This will help you see if your symptoms are getting better, worse, or staying 
			the same.

				Slowing down and deepening your breathing can help you calm down when you feel distress. Put on your headphones or go somewhere private and quiet to be led through the exercise.
				<Content name="@help" displayName="Deep Breathing">
					This activity will guide you through a brief exercise in which you take slower, deeper breaths to help you relax. Taking slow, deep breaths helps 
					you balance the carbon dioxide and oxygen in your blood. This calms your nervous system, creating a "relaxation response." Deep breathing exercises
					can help manage stress and insomnia, focus the mind, and improve health.

				You are about to be led through a progressive muscle relaxation exercise. You will progress through each of your major muscle groups, tensing and relaxing 
				as you go.This exercise takes about 9 minutes. It has audio, so you will need to find a quiet place or put on your headphones now. Sit down 
				in a comfortable chair or lay down.  Do not do this exercise while driving.
				<Content name="@help" displayName="Progressive Relaxation"><![CDATA[
					<p>
						This exercise will guide you, either sitting comfortably or lying down, through tensing and relaxing a sequence of muscle 
						groups. This allows muscles to relax more deeply than usual. This exercise can help decrease heart rate and blood pressure, 
						slow breathing, decrease muscle tension, and clear thinking.  
					</p>
					<p>
						This exercise is also great because over time you can train yourself to really know what tense muscles feel like and what 
						relaxed muscles feel like.   Then, when you recognize that your muscles are tense or becoming tense you can immediately 
						switch your muscles to the more relaxed state because you have trained yourself to know how relaxed muscles feel.

				The RID Tool is for times when you have been triggered by a reminder, or of, a past trauma. You will be led through three steps to manage your distress.
				]]>
				<Content name="@help" displayName="RID Tool">
					<![CDATA[
					<p>
					When you’re triggered or reminded of terrible things that have happened, your mind not only believes that you’re in danger, your mind and your body act
					like you're right back in the traumatic situation.  These lightning fast, automatic reactions are helpful at the time of the actual event because they
					keep you safe in dangerous situations.  But now your automatic reactions to triggers are no longer helpful because back home, you're not in any actual danger.
					</p>
					<p>
					You use the RID tool to stay focused and cope with your triggers.  Remember, triggers confuse your brain and your body into thinking that you’re back 
					in the original situation.  You must clear away that confusion in order to manage your responses. 
					</p>
					<p>
					RID has three steps: The first step, the R in RID, is to Relax or calm yourself.   The second step, the I in RID, is to identify what’s triggering you and 
					how it’s different from your original trauma.  And the third step, the D in RID, is to decide how to respond to the trigger. Doing these three things when 
					you’re triggered can be very helpful.

						<hr/>
						<p>
							Go back over the last few minutes or hours and <b>Identify</b> what reminder of your trauma you encountered. Triggers can be 
							inside ourselves, like thoughts or memories, or outside of ourselves, like conversations or situations or things we 
							encounter in the world (e.g., a particular person or place).  Figuring out what triggered you can be tricky sometimes.  
							Do not worry if you cannot identify the trigger, just focus on relaxing and talking yourself down.
						</p>
						<p>
							Once you identify the trigger if you can, it is important to notice how it is just a reminder and not the actual trauma 
							happening again, despite how your mind and body may be reacting.  Really notice how the current trigger is different from 
							your trauma.  Remind yourself of those differences again and again.

                                    The final step is to <b>Decide</b> what to do now. If you feel stressed now, you can try to decrease the trigger’s power by 
                                    deciding to stick around to see that you can handle it and that your stress will actually go down the longer you stick it out. 
                                    If the trigger made you very angry, your best bet is to decide to take a time out.  If you are in danger of hurting yourself or
                                    others, seek support and don’t take any chances.
