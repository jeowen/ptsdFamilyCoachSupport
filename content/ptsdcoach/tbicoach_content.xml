								<p><b>What is a concussion?</b></p>
								<p>The term &quot;concussion&quot; is used to describe a mild traumatic brain injury, but can also be used to describe brain injuries of all severities. The concussion causes a temporary disruption of brain function that manifests as:</p>
								<ul>
								<li>Loss of consciousness for no longer than 30 minutes,<br/></li>
								<li>Loss of memory for events immediately before or after the injury,<br/></li>
								<li>Confusion or disorientation for no longer than 1 day, and<br/></li>
								<li>Dizziness or balance problems.<br/></li>

								<p><b>When is concussion more serious?</b></p>
								<p>When someone loses consciousness for more than 30 minutes or is disoriented for longer than 1 day after a head injury, the initial injury is likely more serious. In the same way, if something penetrates the skull, such as a bullet, then the injury is considered more severe.</p>
								<p>People can have a wide range and severity of symptoms whether they've had a mild, moderate, or severe head injury. Symptoms from these injuries can be helped with this app.</p>

							<Content displayName="How does concussion happen?" title="Concussion 101" ui="ContentViewController"><![CDATA[
								<p><b>How does concussion happen?</b></p>
								<p>Concussion can come from:</p>
								<ul>
								<li>The head being struck by an object, such as a bat or a fist during a fight,<br/></li>
								<li>The head striking an object, such as the dashboard in a car accident or the ground in a fall, or<br/></li>
								<li>The head being affected by a nearby blast or explosion.<br/></li>

							<Content displayName="What are concussion symptoms?" title="Concussion 101" ui="ContentViewController"><![CDATA[
								<p><b>What are concussion symptoms?</b></p>
								<p>Symptoms from concussion can include:</p>
								<ul>
								<li>Physical: Headaches, sleep difficulties, sensitivity to light or noise, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, balance problems, blurred vision, or feeling very tired.<br/></li>
								<li>Cognitive: Problems paying attention, concentrating, remembering, or processing information.<br/></li>
								<li>Emotional: Anxiety, irritability, or depression.<br/></li>
								</ul>

							<Content displayName="Is it another condition?" title="Concussion 101" ui="ContentViewController"><![CDATA[
								<p><b>Is it concussion or another condition?</b></p>
								<p>A number of other conditions can bring about some of the same symptoms as concussion. Witnessing traumatic events such as seeing someone severely injured or killed can result in similar symptoms. Preexisting pain, headaches, poor sleep, anxiety, stress, alcohol or substance abuse, and other conditions can also result in similar symptoms.</p>
								<p>Speaking to a provider can help determine where the symptoms came from.</p>

							<Content displayName="How long do symptoms last?" title="Concussion 101" ui="ContentViewController"><![CDATA[
								<p><b>How long do symptoms last?</b></p>
								<p>Symptoms of concussion often get better within 1 to 4 weeks. People who continue to have difficulties can usually be helped by a variety of health care professionals and self-help tools like this app.</p>
								<p>Other conditions can affect recovery from concussion. For example, symptoms are likely to last longer if the injury happened during a psychologically traumatic event or to someone who was already stressed about personal problems.  Fortunately, even symptoms made worse by other conditions can be improved with medical care and with using this app.</p>

								<p>Effective treatments for concussion symptoms are available. You don't have to live with your symptoms forever. The most important thing you can do to recover after concussion is to <b>pace yourself, get the rest you need, and get moving on the road to wellness</b>.</p>
								<p>If you've been diagnosed with a concussion, the tools on this app may help you manage your symptoms.</p>

							<Content displayName="Symptoms and stress" title="Concussion 101" ui="ContentViewController"><![CDATA[
								<p><b>Symptoms and stress</b></p>
								<p>Symptoms are your body's way of giving you information. Thinking and worrying about your symptoms can make them seem worse.  This is partly because paying too much attention to a problem may make it seem bigger than it is.</p>
								<p>Doing things you enjoy, are relaxing, and give you a sense of accomplishment will prevent you from over-focusing on your symptoms. After a concussion, it can be easy to forget that we all have times when we feel irritable, tired, have headaches, cannot concentrate, and are forgetful.</p>

						<Content displayName="What are PTHA?" title="Headaches" ui="ContentViewController"><![CDATA[
							<p><b>What are PTHA?</b></p>
							<p>Post-traumatic headaches (PTHA) are any new headaches or worsened headaches that start within 7 days of having a concussion.</p>
							<p>Most PTHAs are the result of direct injury or trauma that strained the muscles covering the head and neck. Symptoms gradually improve as the muscle tissue heals.</p>
						]]></Content>
							<Content displayName="Acute vs. chronic PTHA" title="Headaches" ui="ContentViewController"><![CDATA[
							<p><b>Acute vs. chronic PTHA</b></p>
							<p>Headaches will often get better in a week or so after concussion. Those that go away within 3 months of the injury are called &quot;acute PTHA&quot;. If the headache symptoms last more than three months, they are called &quot;chronic PTHA&quot;.</p>
							<p>Acute PTHA affects 90% of people who have a concussion. Chronic PTHA is the most common pain problem after concussion.</p>
						]]></Content>
						<Content displayName="Tension-type headaches" title="Headaches" ui="ContentViewController"><![CDATA[
							<p><b>Tension-type headaches</b></p>
							<p>Tension-type headaches are the most common kind of headache. They affect 85% of those with PTHA. They're caused by tightness and injury to the skull muscles and feel like tightening or pressure at the temples or around the head, usually on both sides.</p>
						]]></Content>
						<Content displayName="Migraine headaches" title="Headaches" ui="ContentViewController"><![CDATA[
							<p><b>Migraine headaches</b></p>
							<p>Migraine headaches are the second most common type of PTHA, affecting around 3% of people with PTHA. They're caused by spasms of small blood vessels around the skull. The pain is usually only on one side of the head and is often pulsating in nature. The pain is often associated with nausea, light-sensitivity, noise-sensitivity, or dizziness. These symptoms may occur before the pain begins (called &quot;auras&quot;).</p>
						]]></Content>
						<Content displayName="Rebound analgesic headaches" title="Headaches" ui="ContentViewController"><![CDATA[
							<p><b>Rebound analgesic headaches</b></p>
							<p>Rebound analgesic headaches are daily, dull, aching headaches that are caused by using lots of pain medications for a long time without carefully weaning off them.</p>

						<Content displayName="How to assess headache pain" title="Headaches" ui="ContentViewController"><![CDATA[
							<p><b>How to assess headache pain</b></p>
							<p>While everyone describes headache pain in a slightly different way, we recommend using the same scale each time to assess your pain. We'll use a numeric scale to track your pain, where &quot;0&quot; mean no pain and &quot;10&quot; is the worst possible pain you can imagine. Make sure you record your headache pain level (as well as any changes in the &quot;COLDER&quot; symptom inventory) regularly in your wellness journal.</p>
							<p>
						]]></Content>
						<Content displayName="Medication for PTHA" title="Headaches" ui="ContentViewController"><![CDATA[
							<p><b>Medication for acute PTHA</b></p>
							<p>Since almost all PTHA are short-lived, simply using over-the-counter pain medications (acetaminophen, aspirin, ibuprofen) or local heat (hot pack, heating pad) may be all that is needed for an acute headache. Clinicians can also prescribe stronger, prescription medications if pain is more severe.</p>
							<p>Migraine headaches usually respond well to specific medications to prevent them from starting, as well as medications to shorten the symptoms. Ask your doctor about these medications.</p>
						]]></Content>
						<Content displayName="Other treatments for PTHA" title="Headaches" ui="ContentViewController"><![CDATA[
							<p><b>Other treatments for PTHA</b></p>
							<p>Other treatments for acute PTHA include:</p>

							<li>Eating a balanced diet </li>
							<li>Eliminating caffeine, alcohol and tobacco </li>
							<li>Doing relaxation and meditation exercises</li>
							<li>Seeking counseling for stress </li>
							<li>Returning to a normal exercise routine</li>
							</ul>
							<p>There are also special exercise activities for the muscles of the head and neck. You can get more information about these from your medical provider.</p>
						]]></Content>
						<Content displayName="Medication for chronic PTHA" title="Headaches" ui="ContentViewController"><![CDATA[
							<p><b>Medications for chronic PTHA</b></p>
							<p>When PTHA lasts longer than 3 months, it is considered chronic. A brain injury (and headache) specialist should definitely be one of the medical providers you are seeing for care if you have chronic PTHA.</p>
							<p>While specific medications for migraine headaches should continue to be used (and adjusted under the care of your doctor), the continued use of pain medications for chronic PTHA is not usually recommended. Common side effects of long-term narcotic pain medication usage can include addiction, constipation, lethargy and even worsened headaches (rebound analgesic headaches).</p>
						]]></Content>
						<Content displayName="Problems related to chronic PTHA" title="Headaches" ui="ContentViewController"><![CDATA[
							<p><b>Problems related to chronic PTHA</b></p>
							<p>Headaches may be symptoms of other problems such as depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, or alcohol, narcotic and substance abuse that can occur after concussion.  Chronic headache pain can reduce one's ability to function in relationships, at work and school, and in leisure activities.  In addition, people with PTHA may suffer physical symptoms and may be at increased risk of medical problems. If you are having ongoing physical or emotional symptoms related to PTHA, see your doctor.</p>

							<p><b>Causes of anxiety after concussion</b></p>
							<p>Following an injury it is normal to feel a great deal of stress. Stress can build up over time and can lead to anxiety. Anxiety can also occur if you experience too many demands by going back to work too soon after injury. You may have difficulties in situations that require a lot of attention and information-processing, which can make anxiety worse.</p>

							<p><b>PTSD and concussion</b></p>
							<p>The relationship between PTSD and concussion is hard to nail down and it requires a trained specialist to determine how they correlate in your case.</p>
							<p>A person can have one of these problems or both at the same time. Having PTSD may make the symptoms of concussion harder to get past.</p>
							<p>It can be stressful to hear that the problems you have been having since your concussion may actually be fueled in part by PTSD. Some people worry that this means the problem is &quot;all in your head.&quot; However, decades of research on PTSD show that it is a real injury that can have serious effects on a person's life. Luckily, great treatments exist for PTSD that can help with this challenging disorder, with or without a concussion.

							<p>Anxiety is usually treated with psychotherapy and medication. Several types of mental health professionals provide psychotherapy including counselors, social workers and psychologists. Physicians can evaluate your physical condition and prescribe medication. It is important to select a therapist you can talk to comfortably and honestly.</p>

It is most important to look for a trend over time.  Lower scores mean that you have less severe symptoms. So if your line is going down, that is good news. Higher scores mean that you have more severe symptoms, so if your line is going up, you may want to check in with your health care provider and let him or her know of these results (or get a provider if you don't already have one).</p>

                                    When you're triggered or reminded of terrible things that have happened, your mind not only believes that you're in danger, your mind and your body act like you're right back in the traumatic situation.  These lightning fast, automatic reactions are helpful at the time of the actual event because they keep you safe in dangerous situations.  But now your automatic reactions to triggers are no longer helpful because in the 'here and now' you're not in any actual danger.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                    You use the RID tool to stay focused and cope with your triggers.  Remember, triggers confuse your brain and your body into thinking that you're back in the original situation.  You must clear away that confusion in order to manage your responses.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                    RID has three steps: The first step, the R in RID, is to Relax or calm yourself.   The second step, the I in RID, is to Identify what's triggering you and how it's different from your original trauma.  And the third step, the D in RID, is to Decide how to respond to the trigger. Doing these three things when you're triggered can be very helpful.
                                    </p>

										Go back over the last few minutes or hours and <b>Identify</b> what reminder of your trauma you encountered. Triggers can be internal, like thoughts or memories, or external, like conversations or situations or things we encounter in the world (e.g., a particular person or place).  Figuring out what triggered you can be tricky sometimes.  Do not worry if you cannot identify the trigger, just focus on relaxing and talking yourself down.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
										Once you identify the trigger if you can, it is important to remind yourself that it is just a reminder and not the actual trauma happening again, despite how your mind and body may be reacting.  Really notice how the current trigger is different from your trauma.  Remind yourself of those differences again and again.

Most people quickly realise that they can handle it and that their stress will actually go down the longer they stick it out. If the trigger made you very angry, your best bet is to decide to take a time out.  If you are in danger of hurting yourself or others, seek support and don't take any chances.

						<Content weight="50.0" name="progressiveRelaxation" displayName="Progressive Relaxation" title="Relaxation" ui="SimpleExerciseIntroController">
							You are about to be led through a progressive muscle relaxation exercise. You will progress through each of your major muscle groups, tensing and relaxing
							as you go.This exercise takes about 9 minutes. It has audio, so you will need to find a quiet place or put on your headphones now. Sit down
							in a comfortable chair or lay down.  Do not do this exercise while driving.
							<Content name="@help" displayName="Progressive Relaxation"><![CDATA[
								<p>
                                This exercise will guide you, either sitting comfortably or lying down, through tensing and relaxing a sequence of muscle
                                groups. This allows muscles to relax more deeply than usual. This exercise can help decrease heart rate and blood pressure,
                                slow breathing, decrease muscle tension, and clear thinking.
								</p>
								<p>
                                This exercise is also great because over time you can train yourself to really know what tense muscles feel like. Then,
                                when you recognize that your muscles are tense or becoming tense, you can immediately switch your muscles to a more relaxed
                                state because you have trained yourself to know how relaxed muscles feel.

The distress score can help you learn to see the shades of gray, and help you see that even when things aren't perfect, they may be improving. It can also help you learn to recognize what triggers distress for you.</p>

						<p><b>Using your phone for daily activities</b></p>
						<p>Your smartphone has features that can help organize your everyday life and accomplish things you need or wish to do.   
						Using these features may make it easier to keep up with daily activities and help with your recovery.</p>
						<p>If you are very good at finding your way around the smartphone, you can try using the features described on your own.  
						If setting up the smartphone does not come easily, or you are wondering how you can use the features most effectively, you can try 
						working with a healthcare professional, usually a speech pathologist or an occupational therapist, who can customize the smartphone functions for 
						your needs.</p>]]></Content>
						<Content displayName="Calendar" title="Use Technology" ui="ContentViewController"><![CDATA[
						<p><b>Calendar</b></p>
						<p>The calendar app on your phone is helpful for making a daily schedule and setting up your appointments for the future.
						Enter all the information that will allow you to remember the reason for the appointment, such as the name of the person or place, 
						location, and phone number to call. Make sure that the appointment does not overlap with another commitment you have made for the same time slot.</p>
						<p>You can also set up reminders that will alert you well in advance of when an appointment is coming up. This will allow you to 
						make all the preparations you need to get there on time. </p>
						<p>Other calendar apps may have additional features to help you organize your schedule, such as assigning icons or colors to appointments,
						 attaching pictures, linking with a social networking site, or syncing with a web site calendar service.</p>
						]]></Content>
						<Content displayName="Reminders" title="Use Technology" ui="ContentViewController"><![CDATA[
						<p><b>Reminders and Alarms</b></p>
						<p>The reminders app on your phone is a great way to create reminders for yourself if you notice having trouble with memory, or if 
						you want to keep yourself on a sleep schedule. Create descriptive names and use different alert tones for your reminders to help you stick 
						to the routine you want, without having to worry about forgetting things. </p>
						<p>You can set reminders to repeat at the same time every day, or to activate when your phone's GPS detects that you are at a certain 
						location. Additionally, in your phone's settings you can customize the notification alerts you receive from many other apps, such
						as when you receive a text message or a phone call.</p>
						<p>Other alarm apps may have additional features to help you customize your reminders, such as additional repeat options, more alert 
						tones, or the ability to attach a photo or voice memo.</p>
						]]></Content>
						<Content displayName="Timer" title="Use Technology" ui="ContentViewController"><![CDATA[
						<p><b>Timer</b></p>

						is bringing you down. A quick call or a short text can lift your spirits and make the day seem a bit more manageable.</p>
						<p>Other contacts apps may have additional features, such as displaying contacts by their photos, sorting people into groups or lists, or 
						linking to a social networking site.</p>
						]]></Content>
						<Content displayName="Notes" title="Use Technology" ui="ContentViewController"><![CDATA[
						<p><b>Notes and Lists</b></p>
						<p>Use the note-taking or list apps on your phone to jot down ideas or lists of things you'd like to accomplish. Not only will this 
						help you remember things you need to do, it will assist with focusing on one task at a time. </p>
						<p>If you're finding yourself having trouble remembering something or focusing, jot down a note about what it is you need to do. 
						If you're anxious or frustrated, summarize your goal; taking a moment to think about the big picture might help you not sweat the small stuff. 
						If you have trouble getting organized for work, prepare a to-do list in the evening related to getting ready to leave for work.</p>
						<p>Other note-taking or list apps may have additional features, such as multiple notebooks or lists, the ability to attach a photo, voice memo, 
						or map, syncing to your computer, or sharing with friends.</p>
						]]></Content>
						<Content displayName="Voice Recorder" title="Use Technology" ui="ContentViewController"><![CDATA[
						<p>The voice recorder app is another way to make notes to yourself. If you prefer talking to typing on your phone screen, or often have your hands full, 
						this may work better for you. Recording memos can help you remember ideas, list things to do, save a class lecture so you can focus on it later, or 
						relieve stress by talking about something that's troubling you. </p>
						<p>There are many free and low-price voice recorder apps you can add to your phone to have another way to make notes to yourself. If you prefer 
						talking to typing on your phone screen, or often have your hands full, this may work better for you. Recording memos can help you remember ideas, 
						list things to do, save a class lecture so you can focus on it later, or relieve stress by talking about something that's troubling you. </p>
						<p>Some recorder apps may have additional features, such as editing your memos, syncing to your computer, or transcription.</p>
						]]></Content>
						<Content displayName="Maps" title="Use Technology" ui="ContentViewController"><![CDATA[

						you get confused. You can also enter keywords (like "coffee shop") to find a place nearby to relax and reset.</p>

						<Content displayName="Music Player" title="Use Technology" ui="ContentViewController"><![CDATA[

						<Content displayName="Web Browser" title="Use Technology" ui="ContentViewController"><![CDATA[
						<p><b>Web Browser</b></p>

						retrieve a forgotten address or access some information that slipped your mind.</p>
						<p>You can add useful web sites to your bookmarks, add sites directly to the home screen of your phone, or email a web link to yourself.</p>
						]]></Content>
						<Content displayName="Other Apps" title="Use Technology" ui="ContentViewController"><![CDATA[
						<p><b>Other apps</b></p>
						<p>You can download many other apps to help you focus your time better, track daily habits, organize housework, fall asleep to white noise, connect with friends, or find more things to do nearby.</p>

								<p><b>Will it really work?</b></p>
								<p>Scientific evidence shows that many types of therapy and medications really do work.</p>
								<p>It may be hard to imagine now, but you can get past your stress. Counseling may also help ease your transition back home. Like many others that have received counseling, there is a very good chance that you will thank yourself later for sitting through a few uncomfortable hours.</p>
								<p>If you are worried that counselors can't help you or won't understand what you have been through, you may be surprised to find out that this may not be true. Counselors are well trained professionals. Some of them even specialize in working with military personnel and veterans, rape victims, or other special populations. They cannot help or understand you if you don't give them a chance.</p>
								<p>If you have a few sessions with a counselor and you don't think it's going well, you can talk to the counselor about what you want changed or you can ask for a different counselor. Counselors are interested in your recovery and will help you get the person you need.</p>

								<p><b>PTSD treatments that work</b></p>
								<p>The good news is that there are several types of treatment that work for PTSD.</p>
								<p>The best evidence supports cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for PTSD. Two types of CBT that have the most research behind them are Cognitive Processing Therapy and Prolonged Exposure Therapy.</p>
								<p>Research also supports the use of Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing, or EMDR, and finally, medications called Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors, or SSRIs.</p>
								<p>If you have PTSD, you can look for a talk therapist who uses one of these approaches. In the VA, you should have no problem finding someone to provide one of the services listed above.</p>

								<p><b>Logistics of professional care</b></p>
								<p><b>Finding a counselor:</b> A good place to start your search for a counselor is to ask your doctor for a referral.  You can also call you insurance company and ask for suggestions. If you are a veteran, you can also call your local VA hospital or medical facility and ask for recommendations. The number is <a href="tel:1-877-222-8387">1-877-222-8387</a>. You can also check out the Find Professional Care under the Resources &amp; Support tab to find web links to resources for counseling and support.</p>
								<p><b>Cost:</b> Try not to worry about how much counseling will cost, until you have details. Think of counseling as an investment in your health and well-being. It helps you live a happier fuller life. Call your insurance company and find out about your benefits. For veterans, the VA offers free care for combat-related conditions for five years after the person returns from deployment. It also offers services for other veterans as well. Call the VA to determine your benefits at <a href="tel:1-800-827-1000">1-800-827-1000</a>.</p>
								<p><b>Time off from work:</b> If you need flexible appointments so you do not miss work, look for a counselor that will work with your schedule. You want to find a good time where you won't feel rushed. Most employers will understand and help you take care of your health, whether it's physical or emotional. Often, people work out a flexible schedule with their boss to free up time for their appointment.</p>
								<p><b>Transportation:</b> Some people have problems getting to and from appointments. If this is a problem for you, look into public transportation. Another option is to catch a ride with someone. Maybe, you can even arrange to borrow a vehicle. Some counseling centers offer transportation services for veterans. Ask your center if this is offered. Consider all your options. You might be surprised at how many people will take the time to help you get to an appointment.</p>

								<p><b>What does it mean about me if I go for help?</b></p>
								<p>Remember: we are not alone in this world. People are here to help. Perhaps you believe that you should be able to handle your problems without help from others. But, people who use the sources of help around them are able to cope better than those who choose not to. Trying to cope completely by yourself often makes things harder than needed. It adds loneliness and isolation to your problems.</p>
								<p>Don't feel guilty about taking time to get yourself well. You will be better able to live a normal life if you are feeling better.</p>

							<Content displayName="What if I'm embarrassed?" title="Professional Care" ui="ContentViewController"><![CDATA[
								<p><b>What if I'm embarrassed about seeking help?</b></p>
								<p>You don't have to tell people that you're working with a healthcare provider. You can just say you have an appointment and that it's personal.</p>
								<p>Try not to be upset with people that worry about you. Their concern can come from a good place and wanting good things for you. They may be on your side even if they are treating you differently.</p>
								<p>Put yourself in their shoes. Think of a moment when a friend was having a hard time. Did you judge them for it, or were you glad that you could help? Friends, as well as family, want the best for you and are probably looking for ways to help.</p>
								<p>You may think that people will make fun of you for getting help, because at one point you may have overheard someone making fun of someone in your situation.  But you will come to find out that this usually isn't true. It's normal to have problems. Many men and women who served in the military have reported some concern about their mental health after their return.</p>
								<p>Believing that you will be embarrassed and shamed for asking for help is the biggest reason that people, including service members and veterans, don't seek help. But, take a minute to ask yourself the following questions. Is it more important for me to worry about what someone else thinks of me? Or, is it important to get the help I need to move on with my life?</p>
