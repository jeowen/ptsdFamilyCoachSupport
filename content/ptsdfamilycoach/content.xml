                                A safety plan can help prepare you and reduce the risk of physical harm in case you are in a situation where a loved one becomes violent or dangerous.

                                This activity will explain the basics of keeping yourself safe, and then it will guide you through packing and gathering your resources so that you are
                                prepared if you need to be. It may take you 30 minutes to complete. If you cannot finish it in one session, you can come back and work on it more whenever
                                you would like. Once you have completed the activity, you can always return to the <b>Personalize</b> section of the app to look at or edit your safety plan.

						<p>Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition caused by experiencing traumatic events, such as combat, disasters, terrorism, serious accidents, or physical or sexual assault. PTSD is highly treatable.</p>
						<p>It includes 4 types of symptoms:</p>
						<ol>
							<li><strong>Re-experiencing or reliving the trauma</strong>, such as:
								<ul>
									<li>Spontaneous, disturbing memories (flashbacks) that can seem real</li>
									<li>Nightmares</li>
									<li>Becoming very upset when reminded of the trauma</li>

						<h4>How Does PTSD Develop?</h4>
						<p>After a trauma, it's totally normal to be in shock, to have painful memories, and to become upset by reminders. It's also natural that thinking may be negative and exaggerated.</p>
						<p>For most, these reactions will lessen over time. For some, these reactions will continue and will be severe enough to disturb everyday life. It's important to recognize that the greater the severity of the trauma (e.g. injury, belief one would die), the greater the likelihood of PTSD.</p>

					<Content displayName="How Long Does PTSD Last?" title="PTSD Basics" ui="ContentViewController"><![CDATA[
						<h4>How Long Does PTSD Last?</h4>
						<p>PTSD symptoms usually appear shortly after trauma. For most people, these symptoms go away on their own within the first few weeks and months after the trauma.  For some, the symptoms can last for many years, especially if left untreated.</p>
						<p>PTSD symptoms can stay at a fairly constant level of severity, or individuals can have symptoms that vary over time. PTSD symptoms can worsen during times of stress or when individuals are reminded of the trauma by triggers (e.g., anniversary of trauma). How long PTSD lasts also depends on whether effective treatment is received.</p>

					<Content displayName="How Do I Explain His/Her PTSD?" title="PTSD Basics" ui="ContentViewController"><![CDATA[
						<h4>How Do I Explain My Loved One's Behavior to Others?</h4>
						<p>People may ask personal questions about your loved one's absences or mental health. If these situations feel awkward or you're not sure what to say, here are some tips.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Ask your loved one how they want their absences or moods explained. It's up to them, and you, what you feel comfortable saying—including the option to say nothing and change the subject.</li>
							<li>Remember: PTSD is nothing to be ashamed of. At the same time, you don't owe anyone personal information.</li>
							<li>Something simple or vague like &quot;She had something else she needed to take care of&quot; or &quot;He wasn't feeling well / up to it / in the mood&quot; will usually be enough to explain an absence.</li>
							<li>Questions about a loved one's behavior or mental health can be addressed by mentioning that he/she is adjusting to civilian life after deployment.</li>
							<li>If you prefer to side step a discussion, thank them for their concern and tell them that the topic is personal and private, and/or that your family is managing fine.</li>
							<li>Remember, in some cases, you might want to share personal information with trusted others to build connections and social support.</li>

                        <h4>Social Isolation</h4>
                        <p>It's not uncommon for individuals with PTSD to isolate themselves. Family members may be afraid of dealing with their loved one's anxious, irritable or possibly embarrassing reactions in public. Family members may also avoid going out because they do not want to upset their loved ones by leaving. However, isolation can lead to loneliness, depression, and anxiety.</p>
                        <h4>Overcoming Isolation</h4>
                        <p>It's okay to maintain your relationships and socialize and let your loved one stay home if he or she wants. People who accept support are able to cope better than those who do not. Here are some suggestions:</p>
                        <p><b>Spend time with friends and family.</b> This can be social and fun, like a meal, outing or game. It can also be time to talk more personally.</p>
                        <p><b>Join activities and groups.</b> Go to work events, exercise with others, join a book club, or take your child to a playgroup and meet the other parents. Do activities with your church or spiritual/religious community. Join a volunteer organization or a political group. Join a chorus, or a crafting or creative group.</p>
                        <p><b>Join a support group</b> if you need support with a personal or health problem, like pain management, heavy drinking, or a group of other military family members who are facing similar situations.</p>
                        <p><b>Reach out to a counselor</b> for more support and advice if you are still struggling with isolation.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Establish regular bedtime and waking times so your body can get in the habit.</li>
                            <li>Only go to bed when you are sleepy.</li>
                            <li>Ensure that your pillow and mattress are comfortable and supportive.</li>
                            <li>Use your bed only for sleeping and intimacy.</li>
                            <li>Do your best not to nap during the day.</li>
                            <li>Try to only spend as much time in bed as you need hours of sleep (e.g. if you need 8 hours of sleep, don't spend more than 8 hours total in bed).</li>
                            <li>Avoid nicotine, caffeine and alcohol in the evenings.</li>
                            <li>Turn off the TV and computer 30-60 minutes before bedtime.</li>
                            <li>Have a light snack if you are hungry before bed &mdash; try something low in sugar.</li>
                            <li>Keep your bedroom dark and cool. Use an eyeshade and earplugs to keep things dark and quiet.</li>
                            <li>Develop a relaxing bedtime routine.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>When Your Partner Disturbs Your Sleep:</h4>
                        <p>If your partner makes noise in his/her sleep, wakes up upset from nightmares, or has other sleep disruptions due to PTSD, try to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Understand that it isn't his/her fault. This is common after a trauma.</li>
                            <li>Remind yourself he/she isn't doing it to upset or bother you.</li>
                            <li>If it interrupts your sleep too much, consider sleeping separately sometimes.</li>
                            <li>If you choose to sleep separately, make sure you find other ways to connect physically and emotionally.</li>
                            <li>If your partner wakes up, help relax him/her by speaking softly and telling him/her that they are safe at home with you.</li>
                            <li>Ask your partner what you can do to help them sleep better.</li>
                            <li>If it is bothering you a lot or disrupting your sleep a lot, speak to your doctor or a counselor.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Help with Insomnia</h4>
                        <p>Family members are sometimes unable to sleep well because they are depressed or are worried about their loved one. If you find yourself in this situation before bed, try to talk to your partner if they are willing. If can also be helpful to write your worries down then let them go until morning.</p>
                        <p>If you lie awake in bed awake for more than 15-20 minutes without falling asleep, try the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Get up and do something boring, like read your refrigerator instruction manual. </li>
                            <li>If you get up, keep the lights low and do not use your computer or watch TV.</li>
                            <li>Get up and have a glass of water, cup of warm milk, or decaffeinated tea.</li>
                            <li>Have a light snack if you are hungry- try something low in sugar.</li>
                            <li>Read something soothing.</li>
                            <li>Listen to relaxing music. </li>
                            <li>When you return to bed, take some slow, deep breaths for about 10 minutes.</li>
                            <li>Calm your thoughts with prayer, meditation, or &quot;counting sheep&quot;.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Anger</h4>
                        <p>It's not only people with PTSD who struggle with anger. Family members may also feel angry about the trauma and its effect on their lives. You might feel angry if your loved one can't keep a job or drinks too much, won't socialize with you, or is angry and irritable him/herself much of the time.  Some family members feel angry that the trauma happened, and some feel angry that their loved one continues to &quot;dwell&quot; on their trauma and resent that they have added responsibilities.</p>
                        <h4>Dealing with Anger</h4>
                        <p>Individuals with PTSD often struggle with anger and irritability, which can be upsetting to their family members, too. Being angry can make it difficult to think clearly, and it can be hard to have a conversation and feel understood when tempers flare. You and your loved one can get past this anger by understanding that these feelings are no one's fault.</p>
                        <p>Try these tips:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Don't take &quot;moody&quot; or &quot;difficult&quot; behaviors personally.</li>
                            <li>Don't blame yourself for someone else's anger &mdash; remember that you are not the cause.</li>
                            <li>If you're heating up, try taking a time out. This can help you both cool down so that you can have a more constructive conversation and solve your problems later. See the Time Out tool in the Manage Stress section of this app for more information.</li>

                        <h4>Drugs and Alcohol</h4>
                        <p>Family members may try to escape from the difficulties of having a loved one with PTSD by using drugs or drinking.  Also, some partners abuse alcohol or drugs to keep their loved ones &quot;company&quot; when they are using to avoid trauma-related memories and feelings.</p>
                        <p>Unfortunately, avoiding problems with drinking or drugs doesn't make them go away, and often makes them worse.</p>

                        <h4>Anxiety and Depression</h4>
                        <p>Trauma survivors often feel &quot;on edge&quot; and become preoccupied with trying to stay safe.  When one person in a family is overly concerned about potential dangers, it can make everyone else feel afraid too.  Also, actions that help some people with PTSD feel safe, like carrying a gun, can leave others feeling anxious.</p>
                        <p>Family members can be frightened when a trauma survivor is angry or aggressive, especially if they worry about becoming the target.</p>
                        <p>There may be changes in family life when a loved one has PTSD or other symptoms after a trauma, including changes in income, time spent together, and levels of closeness. When PTSD lasts for a long time, you may begin to lose hope that your family will ever &quot;get back to normal.&quot; This can lead to depression, and feelings of grief and loss.</p>

                        <p>Family members of individuals with PTSD can also develop health problems.</p>
                        <p>Bad habits like drinking, smoking, poor diet, and inactivity may worsen as a result of the stress of dealing with a loved one's PTSD.  Also, when family members constantly feel anxious, worried, angry, or depressed, they are more likely to develop stomach and digestive problems, headaches, and muscle pain.</p>

                        <p>Family members who believe that having PTSD is a sign of weakness or damage may be embarrassed or ashamed of their loved one. This may be especially true if the person with PTSD has angry outbursts, flashbacks, or other symptoms of PTSD in public.</p>
                        <p>Embarrassment and shame can lead loved ones to withdraw from others or to keep their problems to themselves. Unfortunately, these strategies can backfire and leave you isolated and unsupported. They also reinforce ideas that PTSD is a sign of weakness or damage, rather than a normal response to abnormal circumstances.</p>

                                <li>Acting like their parent as a way of trying to establish a closer connection. These children might show some of the same symptoms as the parent with PTSD such as being irritable and difficult to be around.</li>
                                <li>Taking on adult roles and responsibilities to &quot;fill in&quot; for the parent with PTSD. This child may act too grown-up for his or her age and get overwhelmed.</li>
                                <li>Exhibiting regressive behavior (e.g., bed wetting, temper tantrums).</li>
                                <li>Personalize the parent with PTSD's behavior as reflecting a problem in them or as something they are responsible for.</li>
                                <li>Needing emotional help for their anxiety (worry, fears) or depression.</li>
                                <li>Showing problems at school and relationship with friends.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>Can Children Get PTSD From Their Parents?</h4>
                            <p>While it is not common, it is possible for children to show signs of PTSD because they are upset by their parent's symptoms. This is called &quot;secondary traumatization.&quot; It is also possible, though not likely, for trauma symptoms to be passed from parent to child or between generations. Here is how it can happen:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>When a family teaches a child not to talk about disturbing events, thoughts, or feelings, the child's anxiety gets worse. He may start to worry about causing the parent's symptoms, or create his own ideas about what happened, which can be worse than the reality.</li>
                                <li>Sometimes parents share too many details about the events. Children may start to have their own PTSD symptoms in response to these terrible images.</li>
                                <li>A child may begin to share in her parent's symptoms as a way to connect with the parent.</li>
                                <li>Children may also re-enact or re-do some aspect of the trauma because they see that their parent has difficulty separating the past trauma from the present moment.</li>

                                <li>Be careful not to share too many details of the event(s) with the child. How much you say depends on your child's age and maturity level. </li>
                                <li>Help them see that PTSD symptoms and trauma reactions are not their fault. </li>
                                <li>Talk about related events and changes together. Listen to their fears and concerns and accept their feelings.</li>
                                <li>Recognize that change is stressful for children just as it is for adults, and be patient. </li>
                                <li>Remember that their feelings toward their parent with PTSD may be mixed—they may feel loving, concerned, protective, and also resentful, anxious, or even angry at times.</li>
                                <li>Help them learn tools to better manage stress. Examples include:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Running or exercising to blow off steam</li>
                                        <li>Drawing or writing for self-expression</li>
                                        <li>Taking deep breaths to relax</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>Give them a journal to keep about these events and their feelings and experiences.</li>
                                <li>Involve them in decisions that affect them when possible.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>Parenting Tips: When PTSD Impacts the Family</h4>
                            <p>Here are some tips for parenting children who are adjusting to living with someone with PTSD.</p>
                            <h4>Educate Yourselves</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Both parents should learn about how PTSD can impact children, and about children's' common responses to having a parent with PTSD.</li>
                                <li>Be aware that children may need extra care, attention, and closeness.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h4>Provide Support</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Continue to talk together. Both parents should listen to their children's feelings and concerns, and take them seriously.</li>
                                <li>Give kids information at a level they can understand about PTSD and about the experiences and changes of their parent with PTSD to ease the confusion and fear of the unknown.</li>
                                <li>Encourage your loved one with PTSD to talk and listen to kids' thoughts and feelings, and to provide reassurance and support for their questions or concerns.</li>
                                <li>Encourage and organize activities (moving around to blow off steam, drawing and writing to express themselves, etc.) that help kids to express themselves and manage stress.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h4>Be Loving and Have Clear Limits</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Be loving, patient and attentive, while also holding clear, consistent limits.</li>
                                <li>Understand kids may act out and misbehave at times, and give them some slack for this. Acting out is a normal response to stress, as long as it doesn't become frequent or cause problems.</li>
                                <li>Praise their positive behavior and better ways of coping.  Always focus on what you appreciate about them.</li>
                                <li>Encourage your loved one with PTSD to focus on quality and fun time with kids and to delay getting involved in disciplining, especially if they are struggling with moodiness or irritability.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h4>Keep Things Ordinary</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Maintain basic family routines like dinnertime and bedtime rituals.</li>
                                <li>Make sure children keep attending school and other regular activities.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h4>Include Them</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Involve kids in family activities. Keep weekends fun with kid-friendly activities.</li>
                                <li>Stay involved in your kids' school and social activities.</li>
                                <li>Ask about their interests and listen without judging or teasing.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>Are My Kids Ok? When to Seek Outside Help</h4>
                            <p>If your child or teenager has trouble adjusting to the stress of living with a parent with PTSD, don't hesitate to contact your doctor or a mental health professional. Here are some signs and symptoms of things to watch out for:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Trouble concentrating or engaging in regular classroom assignments and activities</li> 
                                <li>Intense emotional responses, such as continued crying or intense sadness or moodiness</li>
                                <li>Depression, or acting withdrawn and uncommunicative</li>
                                <li>Expressing violent or depressed feelings in "dark" drawings or writings </li>
                                <li>Significant weight loss or gain, or lack of attention to personal appearance or hygeine</li>
                                <li>Big changes in social activity or friendships</li>
                                <li>Drug or alcohol abuse</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Please seek help immediately if your child intentionally hurts or cuts him- or herself, appears at risk of hurting others, or expresses suicidal thoughts.</p>
                            <p>Children may benefit from individual counseling. Family therapy supports the parent with PTSD and helps family members learn how to get their own needs met.</p>

                            <h4>Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) and Your Children</h4>
                            <p>Here are some things you can do to help protect your children and keep them safe from intimate partner violence (IPV):</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Ask your children straight out if they have ever been abused or experienced violence. In 40% to 60% of families where there is IPV, child physical abuse is also present.</li>
                                <li>Develop a <b>safety plan</b> with and for your children:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Tell your children about safe places to go in the home when conflicts heat up. Practice escape routes with your children.</li>
                                        <li>Teach your children who to call for help in emergencies. Help them to learn important emergency phone numbers by heart. Very clearly explain to them how and when they should call for help.</li>
                                        <li>Some children may try to stop a fight or argument in order to protect their parent. They may get hurt as a result.  Teach your children not to get in the middle of a fight. Teach them what to do instead when a fight occurs. (They could go to a safe place or call emergency numbers.)</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>Talk, and listen, to your children. Most children want the chance to talk about what they are feeling. </li>
                                <li>Try to be honest about the situation without scaring them. Children want to feel they can believe and trust you. </li>
                                <li>Tell them the abuse is not their fault and that they are not responsible for adult behavior. </li>
                                <li>Remind them that violence is wrong and does not solve problems.</li>
                                <li>Consider getting help for your children. Sometimes parents fear being blamed or worry their children will be taken away if IPV is reported. But often the most loving thing you can do as a parent is to seek support for yourself and your children.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>Impact of IPV on Children</h4>
                            <p>You've probably tried your best to keep your children safe and protect them.  You may hope that they aren't aware of the abuse that is happening. However, children often report they have heard or seen the abuse even when their parents didn't realize it.</p>
                            <p>Children are affected by IPV, even if they don't show it right away.  Common effects include:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Feeling angry, insecure, worried, alone, scared, confused</li>
                                <li>Believing they are to blame for the abuse</li>
                                <li>Having mixed feelings towards the abuser and the non-abusing parent</li>
                                <li>Believing they are responsible for stopping the abuse</li>
                                <li>Having physical complaints like headaches and stomachaches </li>
                                <li>Having bad dreams or nightmares</li>
                                <li>Acting younger than their age (e.g. wet the bed, have tantrums)</li>
                                <li>Having social and learning difficulties at school</li>
                                <li>Acting aggressively</li>
                                <li>Withdrawing from others</li>
                                <li>Wanting to stay home due to fear of what may happen to their parent if they go out.</li>

                            <h4>Living with a Partner With PTSD</h4>
                            <p>Adjusting to living with a partner coping with PTSD can be challenging, especially if it's a situation you weren't anticipating. Here are some tips:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Expect things to be different. Take time to understand how your partner has changed, and get to know each other again. </li>
                                <li>Get support. Talk about your feelings with friends, family, and other supports. Talk to a counselor, chaplain, or join a support group. </li>
                                <li>Be patient. Your loved one may be in a lot of distress. Their attitude/outlook may have changed. Go slow as you both adjust to being with each other again.  </li>
                                <li>Learn about PTSD. Read, watch videos, listen to podcasts, etc. to learn about what to expect, how to help, and how to take care of yourself. Talk to a counselor, chaplain, or others about PTSD for more support and information.</li>
                                <li>Take time for yourself to do things you enjoy and see people you care about. Remember that you can't effectively be there for others if you're not rested, nourished and taken care of yourself.</li>
                                <li>Be there for them. Let them know that you'll listen if they want to talk (and see How to Listen Well for some tips). Offer affection and support in physical and practical ways &mdash; show them that you have their back.</li>
                                <li>Give them room when they need it. Don't grill your loved one about their stressful deployment experiences or how they're affecting them. Give them some breathing room and time to adjust.</li>
                                <li>Encourage them to seek help if needed. Offer to help them get professional support, and support them in doing so.</li>

                            <h4>Becoming Close Again </h4>
                            <p>Partners can feel uneasy and relationships may feel strained if one partner is struggling with PTSD.  Here are some tips to help you become closer again as a couple.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Emotional numbing is a symptom of PTSD that may make it difficult to express loving feelings. Recognize that your loved one may have difficulty having positive feelings.</li>
                                <li>Understand that PTSD may lead your partner to be more distant or irritable, and you may not feel as close. Recognize it will take time to reconnect and keep your expectations in check.</li>
                                <li>Talk to each other about your feelings, frustrations and anxieties &mdash; with respect for the other person's feelings! Talking and listening with compassion, can help you understand each other and bring you closer together. </li>
                                <li>Don't jump to the worst conclusions about your partner. Try not to take mood swings and isolation personally. If you have concerns about fidelity, talk to a confidant, counselor or your chaplain.</li>
                                <li>If you tend to withdraw under stress, make an effort to move toward your loved one instead with small favors, little touches, or a few kind words &mdash; then build from there. </li>
                                <li>Avoid saying hurtful things or becoming physically violent with your loved one. Instead, try taking a time out (see the Time Out tool in the Manage Stress section of this app) to calm yourself. </li>
                                <li>Understand that with the stress of PTSD, sexual intimacy may be off the table for the time being. If this is the case, try to focus instead on other ways of being close, like spending fun times together, hugging and kissing, or holding each other.</li>
                                <li>Seek help if needed. Talk to a couples counselor for support for your relationship.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Use statements starting with &quot;I,&quot; such as &quot;I think&quot; or &quot;I feel.&quot; Starting with &quot;you&quot; or saying &quot;you make/made me feel&quot; can sound accusing.</li>
                                <li>Be clear and to the point.</li>
                                <li>Be positive -- request what you want or need. Blame and negativity won't help resolve things.</li>
                                <li>Put your feelings into words. Your loved one may not know you are sad or frustrated unless you are clear about your feelings.</li>
                                <li>Help your loved one put feelings into words. Ask, &quot;Are you feeling angry? Sad? Worried?&quot;</li>
                                <li>Be a good listener. Don't argue or interrupt. Repeat what you hear to make sure you understand, and ask questions if you need to know more.</li>
                                <li>Ask how you can help.</li>
                                <li>Don't give advice unless you are asked.</li>

                            <p>Conflict will always exist in relationships.  Having a loved one with PTSD can intensify these challenges.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Think before you speak. Keeping a cool head goes a long way toward resolving problems.</li> 
                                <li>When you speak, use statements starting with &quot;I,&quot; such as &quot;I think&quot; or &quot;I feel.&quot; Using &quot;you&quot; statements can sound accusing.</li>
                                <li>Take &quot;small bites.&quot; Focus on one issue at a time. </li>
                                <li>During a confrontation, allow the other person equal time to speak his/her mind. </li>
                                <li>When the other person is talking, listen to what he/she has to say without interrupting. Ask questions to be sure you understand. Repeat back what they said to make sure you're &quot;getting it.&quot;</li>

                                <li>Never argue in bed. Use a neutral room, and affirm your love often. </li>

                            <h4>How to Listen Well</h4>
                            <p>If your loved one chooses to confide in you about what they've been through, here are some suggestions to help them feel comfortable and safe:</p>
                            <p><b>Use attentive body language:</b></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Sit forward or upright and use gestures, like nodding, that show you're paying attention.</li>
                                <li>Maintain consistent (not constant or darting) eye contact. </li>
                                <li>DON'T make inappropriate facial expressions. (e.g. raising eyebrows when hearing how they coped)</li>
                                <li>DON'T move around or fidget too much. </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><b>Talk in ways that encourage them to continue:</b></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Show you're listening by saying things like &quot;hmm&quot; and &quot;uh-huh&quot; periodically.</li>
                                <li>Name/say back the emotion being described. (e.g. &quot;Sounds like that was scary for you.&quot;)</li>
                                <li>Ask questions if you are confused, and try to ask questions that require more than a one-word answer. (e.g. &quot;What was that like for you?&quot;)</li>
                                <li>DON'T change the subject or ask questions that are off-topic.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p></b>Show support:</b></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Validate (show understanding for) their emotions in a genuine tone. </li>
                                <li>Point out the person's strengths. </li>
                                <li>Focus on their experience rather than your own.</li>
                                <li>Only give advice when it's requested.</li>
                                <li>DON'T reassure them in a way that might minimize their experience. (e.g. &quot;That was so long ago, maybe you should move on.&quot;)</li>
                                <li>DON'T make judgments about their responses or choices. The stresses of combat and life threat can be difficult for civilians to imagine fully.</li>

                            <h4>Intimate Partner Violence</h4>
                            <p>Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) occurs when a current or former partner uses behaviors or threats that can make you feel scared, controlled, or intimidated. A relationship in which IPV occurs is known as an abusive relationship.</p>
                            <p>IPV can happen to anyone, no matter your education, class, race, ethnicity, culture, religion or sexual orientation. It can happen to men or women, but most information we have is about women as victims. About 22-31% of American women report experiencing IPV at some point in their lives.</p>
                            <p>Intimate Partner Violence can include:</p>

                                <li>Threats of physical or sexual abuse: words, looks or gestures to control or frighten</li>
                                <li>Psychological or emotional abuse: humiliating, putting down, isolating, threatening</li>
                                <li>Stalking: following, harassing, or unwanted contact that makes you feel afraid</li>
                            </ul>

                                <li>Rates of IPV committed by Service members and Veterans have been found to be up to three times higher than rates among civilians. </li>
                                <li>Women Service members and Veterans are more likely than non-Veterans to have experienced IPV. </li>

                            <p>Whether or not you are in an abusive relationship, safety planning is something you can do now to help improve your safety situation. Some important safety practices are as follows:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>If you think that you or your children are in danger, leave the situation right away.</li>
                                <li>Note safe places in your home to go if conflicts heat up. Avoid rooms with weapons (e.g. kitchen) or no exits (e.g. closets, bathrooms).</li>
                                <li>Come up with a code word to use as a distress signal to family, children, and friends. Tell them in advance that if you use the code word, they should get help right away.</li>
                                <li>Pack a suitcase with essentials if you need to leave. Make copies of important legal documents (e.g. driver's license, Social Security cards, birth certificates, medical records showing previous injuries) and set some money aside. Hide these items in a place where your partner will not find them.</li>
                                <li>Make a list of people and agencies you can call or go to in case of an emergency. Learn key phone numbers by heart in case you are without your phone.</li>
                                <li>Talk with someone you trust. Even if you don't discuss details, letting one person know the basics and that you may need their support in the future can help.</li>
                                <li>Consider talking to neighbors about calling the police if they hear loud noises or fighting.</li>
                                <li>Consider talking with a supervisor at work for help with safety planning in your workplace.</li>

                            <p>People who experience IPV often feel ashamed and don't like to talk about it. This can make it hard to seek help. Also, experiencing IPV can make you feel alone, and if you have been threatened, even indirectly, you might feel afraid to seek help.</p>

                            <li>Choose the timing of your conversation carefully.</li>
                            <li>Rehearse what you want to say ahead of time.</li>
                            <li>Tell them you're concerned about how they're doing and suggest that it might be useful to talk to a counselor to get some help with their (angry outbursts, PTSD, sleep problems, heavy drinking, etc). </li>
                            <li>Offer your help and support in finding a counselor.</li>
                            <li>Offer to keep their privacy around counseling if they want that. </li>
                            <li>Come to the conversation prepared with some information about kinds of services available and fees, if you can.</li>
                            <li>Let them know that things like PTSD, depression, and alcohol/substance use problems are common after trauma and are not signs of weakness.</li>
                            <li>Remind them it takes courage to seek care, and that no one can handle everything on their own.</li>
                            <li>Tell them that treatment works. Ask them to just go in for a checkup; they don't have to commit to treatment right now.</li>
                            <li>Realize when to back down.  If your loved one becomes angry or defensive when you bring up the topic of treatment, save the discussion for another time, when it's more likely to be productive (e.g., when they seem more open to it). </li>
                            <li>If your loved one says NO, don't give up.  Some individuals take longer to agree to go to treatment.  </li>
                            <li>If you would like help having this conversation, call Coaching Into Care, a VA service that will help you find the right words to talk to your loved one about seeking help, at <a href="tel:1-888-823-7458">1-888-823-7458</a>.</li>
                            <li>If they are reluctant to talk to you about their problems, or getting help, encourage them to talk to a community leader, a chaplain, or others (e.g., Service members and Veterans) who may be having similar issues.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>If you don't feel better and it's been months or years since the trauma, talking to a counselor may help so that problems don't become chronic or more severe.</li>
                            <li>What you need to talk about may feel too private or sensitive to share with a friend or family member.</li>
                            <li>Professionals who specialize in working with PTSD can help you learn to manage upsetting feelings and unhelpful behaviors, cope with stress, get along better with others, and pursue your goals. </li>
                            <li>Seeking counseling is a sign of strength, not weakness. You are actively taking charge of what needs to be taken care of and improving your ability to help yourself.  </li>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Scientific evidence shows that many types of therapy are effective and only take a few months to complete. Likewise, medications have also been shown to be helpful. </li>
                                <li>Although you might feel awkward at first, you can get used to talking to a counselor quickly, and even come to trust them. </li>
                                <li>Counselors are well-trained professionals, many of whom are specialists who have helped large numbers of other Service members and Vets. The first step in disproving your fear is to give them a chance. </li>
                                <li>If you try a few sessions with a counselor and you don't think it's going well, you can talk to them about what you want changed or ask for a different counselor.  Counselors are interested in your recovery and will help you get the help you need. </li>

							<p>Life can be stressful for anyone and if you have someone with PTSD in your family you may be even more stressed than average. In order to be there for your loved one, you have to manage your own stress. Tracking it is the first step.</p>
							<p>The self-assessment in this app is called the Perceived Stress Scale or PSS. It has been used for many years and has been scientifically validated. It includes 10 multiple-choice questions about how you have been thinking and feeling for the past month.  This assessment cannot give you any kind of a diagnosis but it can give you some information about how stressed you are and if you are getting better or worse over time. </p>
							<p>If your stress is getting out of hand or if you think you might need some help, it's important to talk with a medical provider for more information.</p>

								<p>This graph shows how your scores on the self-assessment have changed over time. It is normal for your stress level to go up and down a bit from day to day.  Many individuals notice a reduction in their stress level as they practice the Manage My Stress tools.</p>
								<p>It is most important to look for a trend over time.  Lower scores mean that you have less severe stress. So if your line is going down, that is good news. Higher scores mean that you have more severe stress. If your line is going up, you may want to check in with your healthcare provider or get a provider if you don't already have one.</p>

					<Content name="@help" displayName="More About Distress"><![CDATA[
						<p>You can rate your distress level &mdash; including stress, anger, physical tension or pain, and more, all rolled into one &mdash; on a scale of 0 to 10. This will help you monitor your distress levels and figure out which tools work best for you. You can also use it in your daily life to check in and see how you're doing.</p>
						<p>It may seem strange at first, but sometimes we can get caught up in an all-or-nothing way of thinking &mdash; either I'm totally uncomfortable or I'm totally fine. The distress score can help you learn to see the shades of gray, and help you see that even when things aren't perfect, they may be improving. It can also help you learn to recognize what triggers distress for you.</p>

					<p>The Change Your Perspective tool provides reminders that can help give all members of the family greater hope and confidence. We all have a constant stream of thoughts running through our minds &mdash; this is called self-talk. <i>Negative</i> self-talk, like believing that things are terrible or that the worst is about to happen, can increase stress and affect everyone's mood. These <i>positive</i> self-talk reminders give you something to hold on to; they can help everyone in the family to think more realistically, and may even help them cope more effectively.</p>
					<p>Although it can be hard to believe, changing the way you think really can change the way you feel. However, if you are in real danger or there are serious consequences for your current situation, this tool may not be a good option until emotional and physical danger has passed. If anyone in the family is feeling unsafe, don't use this tool to deny the reality of the situation. Make sure the family has a plan to keep everyone safe if that becomes an issue; see I Feel Unsafe in the Manage section of this app.</p>

Especially if you're feeling down, it can be hard to get motivated to do the things that would usually be fun or give you a feeling of accomplishment. However, research shows that making an effort to do these things, even when you don't feel like it and even if they're pretty small things, can ultimately improve your mood.</p>

							Slowing down and deepening your breathing can help you calm down when you feel distress. Put on your headphones or go somewhere private and quiet to be led through the exercise.
							<Content name="@help" displayName="Deep Breathing">
								This activity will guide you through a brief exercise in which you take slower, deeper breaths to help you relax. Taking slow, deep breaths helps
								you balance the carbon dioxide and oxygen in your blood. This calms your nervous system, creating a "relaxation response." Deep breathing exercises
								can help manage stress and insomnia, focus the mind, and improve health.

						<!-- Progressive Muscle Relaxation -->
						<Content weight="50.0" name="progressiveRelaxation" displayName="Progressive Relaxation" title="Relaxation" ui="SimpleExerciseIntroController">
							You are about to be led through a progressive muscle relaxation exercise. You will progress through each of your major muscle groups, tensing and relaxing
							as you go.This exercise takes about 9 minutes. It has audio, so you will need to find a quiet place or put on your headphones now. Sit down
							in a comfortable chair or lay down.  Do not do this exercise while driving.
							<Content name="@help" displayName="Progressive Relaxation"><![CDATA[
								<p>
                                This exercise will guide you, either sitting comfortably or lying down, through tensing and relaxing a sequence of muscle
                                groups. This allows muscles to relax more deeply than usual. This exercise can help decrease heart rate and blood pressure,
                                slow breathing, decrease muscle tension, and clear thinking.
								</p>
								<p>
                                This exercise is also great because over time you can train yourself to really know what tense muscles feel like. Then,
                                when you recognize that your muscles are tense or becoming tense, you can immediately switch your muscles to a more relaxed
                                state because you have trained yourself to know how relaxed muscles feel.

                                The RID Tool is for times when you have been triggered by a reminder of a past trauma. You will be led through three steps to manage your distress.

								<![CDATA[
                                    <p>
                                    When you're triggered or reminded of terrible things that have happened, your mind not only believes that you're in danger, your mind and your body act like you're right back in the traumatic situation.  These lightning fast, automatic reactions are helpful at the time of the actual event because they keep you safe in dangerous situations.  But now your automatic reactions to triggers are no longer helpful because in the 'here and now' you're not in any actual danger.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                    You use the RID tool to stay focused and cope with your triggers.  Remember, triggers confuse your brain and your body into thinking that you're back in the original situation.  You must clear away that confusion in order to manage your responses.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                    RID has three steps: The first step, the R in RID, is to Relax or calm yourself.   The second step, the I in RID, is to Identify what's triggering you and how it's different from your original trauma.  And the third step, the D in RID, is to Decide how to respond to the trigger. Doing these three things when you're triggered can be very helpful.
                                    </p>

										Go back over the last few minutes or hours and <b>Identify</b> what reminder of your trauma you encountered. Triggers can be internal, like thoughts or memories, or external, like conversations or situations or things we encounter in the world (e.g., a particular person or place).  Figuring out what triggered you can be tricky sometimes.  Do not worry if you cannot identify the trigger, just focus on relaxing and talking yourself down.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
										Once you identify the trigger if you can, it is important to remind yourself that it is just a reminder and not the actual trauma happening again, despite how your mind and body may be reacting.  Really notice how the current trigger is different from your trauma.  Remind yourself of those differences again and again.
                                        </p>

Most people quickly realise that they can handle it and that their stress will actually go down the longer they stick it out. If the trigger made you very angry, your best bet is to decide to take a time out.  If you are in danger of hurting yourself or others, seek support and don't take any chances.

					<Content name="timeOutHelp" displayName="Time Out"><![CDATA[
					This exercise allows you to take a break from a situation that is upsetting you (or someone else) before you do something you'll regret.  A time out is a time-limited break (often 10-15 minutes) that helps people manage their anger, anxiety, or confusion so that they can resolve their problems more effectively. The time out exercise offers more instructions and guidance on how and when to take a time out, and what to do to help yourself during your time out.

The distress score can help you learn to see the shades of gray, and help you see that even when things aren't perfect, they may be improving. It can also help you learn to recognize what triggers distress for you.</p>

                A safety plan can help prepare you and reduce the risk of physical harm in case you are in a situation where a loved one becomes violent or dangerous.
                </p>
                <p>
                This activity will explain the basics of keeping yourself safe, and then it will guide you through packing and gathering your resources so that you are
                prepared if you need to be. It may take you 30 minutes to complete. If you cannot finish it in one session, you can come back and work on it more whenever
                you would like. Once you have completed the activity, you can always return to this part of the app to look at or edit your safety plan.
                </p>
                <p>
                Remember: safety plans only work if they are put into place <b>in advance</b>. So, work though this activity now, before you need it.

	<Content name="changePerspectiveHelp" displayName="Change Perspective"><![CDATA[
		<p>The Change Perspective tool provides reminders that can help give you hope and confidence. We all have a constant stream of thoughts running through our minds—this is called self-talk.  
		Negative self-talk, like believing that things are terrible or that the worst is about to happen, can increase your stress and affect your mood. These positive self-talk reminders give you 
		something you can hold on to; they can help you think more realistically, and may even help you cope more effectively.</p>
		<p>Change Perspective suggestions are offered at random; if the first one doesn't work for you, shake your phone for a different suggestion.  Remember: if you are in a traumatic or abusive situation, this tool may not be appropriate for you until emotional and physical danger has passed.</p>

	<Content name="timeOutHelp" displayName="Time Out"><![CDATA[
		<p>A time out is a time-limited break from a conflict that helps people manage their anger so that they can resolve their conflicts more effectively.  This exercise allows you to take a break from a conflict that is heating up before you (or someone else) do something you'll regret.</p>
		<h4>Before the Time Out</h4>
		<ul>
		  <li>With strangers, taking a time out may just mean walking away.  With people you know, time outs can help you keep those relationships healthy and strong.  Talk and agree beforehand on rules for using time outs.  </li>
		  <li>Suggested rules:</li>
		  <li>Either person can &lsquo;call&rsquo; a time out if things get heated, and both will abide by it.  </li>
		  <li>When someone asks for a time out, the discussion ends immediately. Don't try to get in your last words- this usually isn't helpful.</li>
		  <li>The conversation is postponed until both people are calm.</li>
		  <li>The conversation is <em>not</em> dropped- time outs are not a way to get out of talking.</li>
		  <li>If the person initiating the time out leaves, they say where they will be and when they will return.</li>
		  <li>The person <em>not</em> calling the time out does not follow, call or text the other person unless there is an emergency.</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>During the Time Out</h4>
		<ul>
		  <li>Use this time to cool down so that you can have a productive discussion later.</li>
		  <li>During this time it is not helpful to obsess about your anger, how wrong the other person is, or how justified you are.</li>
		  <li>One way to use this time is to think of options to solve the problem you&rsquo;re facing, or to improve the situation and make things work for both/all of you.</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>After the Time Out</h4>
		<ul>
		  <li>Listen, and try to see the other person's perspective.</li>
		  <li>Speak for yourself only: use &ldquo;I&rdquo; language.</li>
		  <li>Be flexible and open to compromise.</li>
		</ul>

		These are activities to help you increase the amount of pleasure and satisfaction in your life. Especially if you're feeling down, it can be hard to

		these things, even when you don't feel like it, can ultimately improve your mood. Pleasant Activity suggestions are offered at random; if the first 
		one doesn't appeal to you, shake your phone for a different suggestion.

	<Content name="distractHelp" displayName="Distract Yourself"><![CDATA[
		These are suggested activities to help you distract yourself from overwhelming emotions and the situations that may be triggering them. Distracting 
		yourself may not completely make your feelings go away, but it can make tolerating them a little easier. Distract Yourself suggestions are offered at random; 
		if the first one doesn't work for you, shake your phone for a different suggestion.
